*How did this go, overall?*

**there is an array of some pictures we need to put 3 picture in HTML and changed randomly we use validation with while to not repeated picture and see 3 different picture the user should choose one of them by click there is25 trying for the user to choose then print them as a list contain each element that click on and how many time shown and clicked by the user**

**then make the chart for picture name on x-axies and time shown and time click on y-axies**
**and when three images appear on screen the next 3 image must be different.**

**we use a local storage with set item to set the object as string and get item to git the string as object and the lab work as when we clear the storage and click for example 5 times then ref reach the Page the list for view and clicked will saved and when i refresh and complete until click =25 stops and the list views on the screen saved and contain all the clicked and viewed item with total click**
